# Welcome to bnet_rg (Bayesian Network Renormalization Group)


This python software was written as an appendix to a chapter
for my free open source book 
["Bayesuvius"](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius). The
subject of the chapter is Renormalization Group techniques as they 
apply to 
Bayesian networks.

As an example of this subject, we analyze a 2-dim Ising-like
dynamical Bayesian Network.
