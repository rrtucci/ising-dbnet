# Welcome to bnet_rg (Bayesian Network Renormalization Group)


This python software was written as a supplement to 
Chapter 93
entitled " Renormalization Group for Bayesian Networks", 
of my free open source book 
["Bayesuvius"](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius). 

If you just want to download Chapter 93 
instead of the whole book,
[here is a link](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius/blob/master/bnet_rg-chapter.pdf) 
to Chapter 93 only.



As an example of this subject, we analyze a 2-dim Ising
dynamical Bayesian Network (dbnet).

from included Jupyter notebooks)
