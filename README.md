## bnet_rg (Bayesian Network Renormalization Group)

# Welcome to bnet_rg. 

This python software was written as an appendix to a chapter
for my free open source book 
[https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius]("Bayesuvius"). The
subject of the chapter is Group techniques as they 
apply to 
Bayesian networks.

from included Jupyter notebooks)
