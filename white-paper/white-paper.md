The white-paper for this study is Chapter 93
entitled " Renormalization Group for Bayesian Networks", 
of my free open source book 
["Bayesuvius"](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius). 

If you just want to download Chapter 93 
instead of the whole book,
[here is a link](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius/blob/master/bnet_rg-chapter.pdf) 
to Chapter 93 only.
