It then prints for every notebook it finds (1) a hyperlink to the notebook, and (2) the first cell (which is always markdown) of the notebook. This way you can read a nice, automatically generated summary of all the notebooks without having to open all of them. If you find a notebook that you want to explore further, you can simply click on its link to open it."
