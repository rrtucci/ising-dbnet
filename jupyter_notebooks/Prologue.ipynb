    "1. Our 2-dim Ising-dbnet model exhibits a discontinuity in the magnetization at the same Curie temperature as the standard vanilla 2-dim Ising model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For $p0\\neq .5$, the parametric curves flow smoothly as $\\beta\\rightarrow \\infty$, towards $(H(y), H(y\\mid x))=(0,0)$, where the efficiency is discontinuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For $p0=.5$, the parametric curves flow smoothly as $\\beta\\rightarrow \\infty$, vertically down."
